According to global statistics, there are approximately 2.2 billion badminton players worldwide and more than 3 million in Taiwan. This single sport is ranked second in terms of national popularity. In recent years, badminton players have achieved outstanding performances in international competitions, gradually increasing the public attention.

In terms of badminton skills and tactics analysis, our team has proposed a match shuttlecock recording format and developed a computer vision assisted quick shuttlecock labeling program to initiate the research of badminton big data. Although many computer-assisted techniques have been used, manual shuttlecock labeling still requires manpower and time, especially for technical data identification, which requires badminton experts to perform. Through this competition, we hope to invite machine learning, image processing, and sports science expertise to develop an automatic shuttlecock labeling model with a high recognition rate, making the massive badminton information collection possible, and thus popularizing the research and application of badminton tactics analysis.
